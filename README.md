# Sanic-Barebone-Template
> Sanic + Jinja2 + Bootstrap

## Prelude
This is a template repository for quickly getting a barebone sanic webserver with Jinja2 templating running.
Templates are built upon Bootstrap _(v5.0 beta 3 at the time of writing)_.

I've recently worked more on web related things so I figured I'd make my template OSS.

## What's inside?
- Barebone sanic webserver + Exemplary blueprint for routing
- Jinja2 presetup with _"proper"_ structure for pages
	- `Foundation.jinja2` servers as the base for all with bootstrap as framework of choice here to get up and running quickly
- No DB drivers
	- This is completely up to you!
- dotenv support for secrets

## Purpose
You can use this template to create static sites which do not rely on databases or extend this as you wish to inlcude your own drivers and fledge it out.
